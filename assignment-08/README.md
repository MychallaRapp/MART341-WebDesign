1. The id attribute is a unique identifier for a page's element. The class attribute is an
   identifier for a group of similar elements. The div element can group other elements together and is used
   to make the page easier to read and understand. The span element is used to add styling to content
   in the div block.
2. YouTube is a great place to post audio and video files at a high quality. YouTube also makes it
   so that your video/audio file is already compatible with all browsers. However YouTube is
   not great for image files and any copyrighted materials used can be easily reported, whether
   or not it falls under fair use.
3. This week the only problems I had were making sure the correct syntax was used and getting the audio and video to play.
