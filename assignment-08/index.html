       <h1>Lyrics</h1>
       <p>All the bad boys want some brawl, it's tricky
          And girls enjoy, they feel so lucky
          Laughing at weeds running out the door
          Calling their mom when they lick the floor
          Look how those funky monkeys talk and walk in store
          They're lost, sad and brawny like an apple core
          Who can believe that there will be some gore?
          With those wimps like I said before</p>

        <p>It ain't right, babe, no
           It ain't right, no, no
           Mama, don't do that, you know
           It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy</p>

       <p>It ain't right, babe, no
          It ain't right, no, no
          Mama, don't do that you know
          It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy</p>

      <p>Bad boys are not so picky
         They ride away and feel so happy
         To fight for girls they do adore
         Snorting like boars rolling on the floor
         With their leather jacket and their rocky voice
         They hit, fight, kick, wreak havoc and rejoice
         Nobody knows what they're looking for
         A kind of battle axe or maybe more</p>

      <p>It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
         It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy</p>

      <p>When a bad boy tramp sounds, it's freaky
        'Cause you're afraid, remember he's lanky
        Don't rate him, even he gets sore
        Cross the river and roam the shore</p>

      <p>It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
         It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy</p>

      <p>It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy
         It ain't right, babe, no
         It ain't right, no, no
         Mama, don't do that, you know
         It ain't right, yeah, soldier boy</p>
