1. After reading the pages for this week I noticed that there are more
   forms than I thought. I always saw forms as those boxes that ask for your
   information and didn't see browser search bars as forms.
2. An example of a text box would be Amazon asking for your address. A selection
   example would be Steam asking for your age to allow you to see a game's page.
   An example of button input would be typing something into a search bar and
   hitting the submit button after.
3. For this week I didn't really have any issues because I was moving slow and
   checking the website to make sure that everything was typed correctly.
