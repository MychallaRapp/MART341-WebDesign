1. The head tag has five elements. The meta, viewport, title, link, and style.
   The body tag contains holds the content of the page such as headings, images,
   hyperlinks, etc. The head tag holds information that tells the browser about
   the page. This information is not shown to the user while the body tag is
   the part that users actually see.
2. Semantic markup is meant to add emphasis to the page. It includes making
   certain words bold and adding citations. Structural markup organizes the
   information on the page using headings, paragraphs, lists, and breaks.
3. For this week I had to get used to using the meta tags because I've never
   used this tag before. I understand how they are used, although I will have to
   go back to the meta page for a few weeks just to make sure that I'm using it correctly.
   The main challenge this week was trying to get the image to appear. I tried
   moving the link to other parts of the document, retyping it, and checking to make
   sure that all of the correct symbols are used.
