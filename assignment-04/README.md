1. Browsers work by sending requests to a server. The server then sends
   the web content and the browser interprets that content. Currently I use
   Chrome to surf the web.
2. The markup language is the page's structure. A commonly used markup language
   is Extensible Hypertext Markup Language(XHTML). Its a combination of HTML
  and XML that allows for sites created using HTML can function on all devices.
  However, because it requires precision, it takes longer to write.
