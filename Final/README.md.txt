1. In this class I learned more things GitHub could do. For example I hadn't really used the desktop version before and I was confused when I started using it, but became more confident in using it.

2. While working in this class I learned how to add fonts, use bootstrap to create responsive designs, and how to include videos on websites.

3. Due to me working off of previous assignments, I didn't have a lot of issues. The biggest problem I had was making sure that the correct symbols were in the correct place.
