1. Thankfully most of what has been covered so far has been topics that I've
   already learned from previous classes. The only things that are new to me
   are the meta tags and the iframe tags.
2. I know the basics of CSS so I'm excited to learn more about it.
3. One of my first issues was with the style tag. While trying to use the style tag
   the rest of the code in the program I use turned purple which meant that there was an error.
   Thankfully the problem was easily fixed. After that, I didn't really have any other issues.
