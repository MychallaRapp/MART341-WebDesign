1. A system font is already installed onto your system and is accessibly by you and most programs, but not to the web.
   A web font is hosted on a server and require certain elements to be called, but don't have to be installed on a computer.
   A Web-safe font is a font that appears on both Windows and Mac.
2. If browser can't use the main font, fallback fonts can be used to give the text a similar appearance to the main font.
3. My main issue was getting the fonts to appear on my page.
