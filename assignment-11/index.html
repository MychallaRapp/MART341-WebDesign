  <h1>Dracula's Guest</h1>

    <div class = "first paragraph">
      When we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich, and the air was full of the joyousness of early summer.
      Just as we were about to depart, Herr Delbruck (the maitre d’hotel of the Quatre Saisons, where I was staying)came down, bareheaded, to the carriage and,
      after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still holding his hand on the handle of the carriage door:

      “Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is a shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm.
      But I am sure you will not be late.” Here he smiled, and added, “For you know what night it is.”

      Johann answered with an emphatic, “Ja, mein Herr,” and, touching his hat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after signaling him to stop:“Tell me, Johann,
      what is tonight?” He crossed himself, as he answered laconically:”Walpurgisnacht.” Then he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as big as a turnip,
      and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders.

      I realized that this was his way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay, and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started off rapidly,
      as if to make up for lost time. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked around in alarm.
      The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, windswept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but little used, and which seemed to dip through a little, winding valley.
      It looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop-and when he had pulled up, I told him I would like to drive down that road.
      He made all sorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself.
